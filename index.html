<!--            Change this to be more pertinent to current state of project-->
                <p id = "intro" class = "">     As Graduate students, we are all at a point of our lives when we must decide where to live as we begin our careers. There are many factors that affect this decision, and those factors may not be the same for everyone. However, we believe there are a few core factors that are shared amongst all people looking to relocate and find "home". There are a few “Quality of life” measures, such as NerdWallet’s cost of living index, but they tend to be extremely general, and as a result, quite inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the metrics used by these indexes are not the best representation of what we believe people look for when they move to a new area. </p>
                <br>
                <p>We decided to remedy this situation by creating our own way to determine where we want to live. Primarily using a KNN model built off of data we gathered from a variety of sources, we hope this will inform your decision on where to live! </p>

            <p id = "instructions"> Our tool is presented through 3 visualizations.   </p>
            <p> <b>–––</b> First is a choropleth map showing the average of all cities throughout the state for the variable you would like to see. If you would like to see the specific value for each state, you can hover over them to see the average of all cities in that state for the selected metric. 
            </p>
            
            <p> <b>–––</b> Once you have examined the other two visualizations and have determined a city that has a lot of the factors which you would like for your ideal city, you can go to our KNN model at the bottom, which is shown as a map with all cities displayed. If you click on a city, the 5 most similar cities in all metrics are highlighted on the map. If you would like to increase this number, you can in the entry box above the visualization. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>–––</b> Lastly, If you find a variable that you are interested in, you can click on a state in the choropleth to select it. Then, below the choropleth you will find a selection windows for the cities in the state. You can select one or more cities in selection window under <b>"Data Exploration"</b> to visualize it in a bar chart below the graph. . 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Each of these can be accessed in the below segment. For all three visualizations, there are controls present in the top right section for each visualization.</p>
            <br>
            <p>–––––</p>
            <p>Firstly, there is a variable selection. This changes the variable represented by the choropleth, as well as the variable displayed in the bar chart. Changing this variable will reload the choropleth.</p> <br>
            <p>In the choropleth, you can hover over states to see a tooltip describing their statistics. This tooltip includes the name of the state, the value of the variable selected, and the number of cities in that state that is represented in our dataset.
            </p> 
            <p>In the choropleth, if you like a specific state's data, you can click on the state to highlight it. This opens the state up for the next two modes of analysis. If you have selected a state, you can double click on the state to unselect it, allowing you to select a different state.</p><br>
        
            <p>–––––</p>
            <p>Next, in the KNN section, there is a selection window for the city you would like to select. This list of cities is pulled from the state which is selected, so if you are unable to select a city you should first select a state. </p>
            
            <p>Below this dropdown, there is a slider to represent the number of cities you would like to see. It defaults to 5, but you can move it to the far left to remove the dots, or to the far right to display 20 cities.</p>
            <p>When you have a city selected and the proper number of cities selected, dots will show up on the map where the most similar cities are located. The selected city is represented by a black dot, the most similar by a red dot, and the rest by yellow dots. These can be hovered over to learn the name and rank of city.</p>
            
            <p>–––––</p>
            <p>Last, in the data exploration section, when there is state selected, there is a dropdown which displays all cities within the state that is selected. You can then select multiple responses from this dropdown, and then click "show me the money" to have the selected cities' values for the seleceted variable displayed in a barchart below the map.</p>
            <p>If you would to remove the barchart, you can click the reset button. This also unselects all cities that were previously selected, so you will need to adjust the selected cities.</p>
