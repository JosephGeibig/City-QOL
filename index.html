There are many factors that affect this decision, and those factors may not be the same for everyone. However, we believe there are a few core factors that are shared amongst all people looking to relocate and find "home". There are a few “Quality of life” measures, such as NerdWallet’s cost of living index, but they tend to be extremely general, and as a result, quite inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the metrics used by these indexes are not the best representation of what we believe people look for when they move to a new area. </p>
